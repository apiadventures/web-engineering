# [fit] What's
# [fit] **_Digital Sport_**
# [fit] about then?

---

# [fit] ?

There is some technical content.

**_Stop us and ask_** if we say something you don't understand.

^ We don't just want to talk at you for 50 minutes.

---

# [fit] What's our purpose?

---

# [fit] Bring the **_breadth and depth_** of Sport
# [fit] to the **_majority_** of people
# [fit] through The BBC's **_online services_**.

---

# [fit] Why?

---

# [fit] Live Sport on TV is fragmented

There is no one place on TV for all of your sport.

There are four major players in the UK:

- BT Sport
- ITV
- Sky Sports
- The BBC

^ So just trying to get access to Live Sport is difficult as depending on what you want to watch you might not have access to it.
^ Thats the first problem

---

# [fit] ?

^ So if you want to watch live sport how do you do that? Short of buying all the broadcasted sport available I have no answer for you.

---

# Live sport is expensive

Some sport on The BBC and ITV is available with your TV License - £145.50.

The rest is extra.

### BT Sport is £335.88
## Sky Sports is £546.00

^ The second problem is that live sport is expensive
^ For £145.50 you get some sport on the BBC and ITV
^ For the rest you have to pay extra for it.

---

# Why is live sport so expensive?

---

# [fit] Broadcast rights cost a
# [fit] _**fortune**_

---

For example, TV rights to the FA Premier League cost Sky Sports and BT Sport

# [fit] £5,136,000,000

... for 168 games[^1].

The cost of a game is around **_£10,190,000_**.

So for a 90 minute football match that's around

# [fit] £1,800 per second

---

The entire budget for the BBC in the financial year 2014-2015 was

# [fit] £4,805,000,000

... and we do TV, Radio and employ 19,000 people[^2] ...
