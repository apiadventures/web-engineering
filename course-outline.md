# Web Engineering## Course GoalGeneral format of each module is a 2 hour lecture slot.Delivered over 10 week Michaelmas term (Oct - Dec) in Lancaster + 3 day intensive in MCUK in Jan/Feb?### AudienceGenerally applicable to the wider audience, both technical and more management focusedi.e. should be sensitive to the issues of (say) using google appengine, the T&Cs and what this does toorganisational data, as well as the broad architecture and bottlenecks etc.## Initial Ideas for Course Structure### 1. Architecture (ade / nige)* basic architecture of web applications, trade offs in partitioning, design for scale	### 2. Platforms as a Service (ade)* app engine, elastic cloud, differences, similarities, design trade offs### 3. Toolkits (sarah)* templating, backend, django?### 4. Programming* jQuery?, Closure?, programming large appsPERHAPS DROP THIS.  Think this can work providing it's about 'why closure etc help you achieve large scale/reliable', i.e. why choose a particular technology - what should you look for when managing a project like this### 5. Storage* could be (couch?, mySQL?, cloud storage ) – maybe move to DB world! although there is an Academy module on storage, so, maybe* linked data (ldp)	* Tom G to expand### 6. Security (dan?)* Perhaps BBC CIS Checklist (OWASP) and PIPELINE example - a rela case study### 7. Analytics (nige)* what you can measure, what you shouldn't measure, universal measurement protocol* A/B – Multi variant testing### 8. Accessibility (henny - guest)* internationalization, accessability	* henny to provide details### 9. Mobile / Responsive Web Design (will / andrew - guest)* developing for mobile, html5, cutting the mustard, layouts, grids, etc### Software Lifecycle* Engineering Excellence	* BBC's 4 Good Things (™)		* Code reviews, pairing, CI, automation, 	* Defintion of Don (DoD)	* PIPELINE process	* NFRs		**  e.g. 2012 template* Development Process	* Behaviour and test Driven (TDD / BDD)	* Branching, Merging, etc.### Other possible topicsdebugging, testing, e-commerce, SEO, backwards compatibility, estimation## Thoughts about associated labs### Lancaster (long thin course)10 x 1 hour - Each lab has a 1 hour experimental lab with a multi choice test (large number of students, so ease of assessment important)Labs should directly relate to the lecture topicEach lab needs a prep task - which is the reading/self-studyThey need a final essay or a reflective piece## Actions* Determine and agree delivery timescale* Keith	* Chat to Henny (Accessibility)	* Chat to Tom G (ldp)	* Chat to Andrew and Will (Responsive)	* Think about an exercise/assignment - ala connected studio / sport / people ?* Nigel	* Think about graduate and masters level differences	* Accreditation thing
